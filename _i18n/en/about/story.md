Once upon a turbulent night, when lightning streaked across the sky and thunder echoed through the city, three friends and seasoned colleagues found themselves huddled in a small café. As the storm raged outside, they fervently discussed their shared vision of revolutionizing the tech industry. With backgrounds in public cloud, industrial internet of things, and diverse expertise, they dreamt of creating a company that would be a force of nature.

Inspired by the tumultuous weather surrounding them, they aptly named their venture "Global Storm." The name symbolized the power they envisioned their startup would wield in the ever-evolving tech landscape. The storm outside mirrored the energy and passion brewing within their hearts, propelling them to embark on this daring journey.

United by their friendship and a collective wealth of experience, they weathered the challenges that came their way. The stormy night served as a metaphor for the obstacles faced during the early days of the startup – uncertainty, risk, and the need for resilience.
