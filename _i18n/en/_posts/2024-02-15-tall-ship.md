It has been some busy time for us since the last news about the box. We have worked many different angles on how to improve the design and efficiency of our box, our startup, our offereings and many other things.

One of the more interestng things we have been doing recently is Predictive Maitenance research and data collection on a Tall Ship. Wojtek had a two-month getaway planned, long before we have decided to start this amazing venture. For two months he works as a 2nd mate on a tall ship STS Fryderyk Chopin.

We have decided not to waste two months worth of time, nor this amazing opportunity. A ship has tons of amazing equipment like engines, power generators, pumps, electronics and many more that have to be monitored and maitenanced. This gives us a lot of space for finding and desigining solutions, improvements and upgrades that will provide more reliablility and will make the life of ship's chief enginner a bit easier.

One of the challange here is the connectivity, which, especially in case of internet, is non-existent or very limited in the middle of the sea. This means all solutions need to be very well optimized and work offline to have any chance for real world use.

This opportunity also gave us a chance, to test Starlink, which works wonderfully close to the shore and pretty well on the sea. Starlink is a bit pricey, but possiblliy in the future it can open ships and yachts to e-mobility. This gave us some really cool IoT ideas, we could implement on the ship. Testing Starlink also gave us assurance that having a camping workation in the middile of nowhere is quite possible and is something, that we will deffinetly do in the near future.

Lastly, if you are wondering, what are 2nd Mate's responsilibilites on the ship, besides collecting data for IoT purpouses:
- Navigation watch from 4-8 am & pm
- Handling the crew, lines and sails on mid-ship suring manouvers
- Keeping paper charts up to date
- Planning the route of the cruise
- Transporting crew using dingy
- Other small tasks like changing a navigation lighbulb on top of a 5 story high mast for example
