For our team at Global Storm opportunity to tease new ideas knows no time and place even when out at sea on a trip of a lifetime. Recently Wojciech Zydecki took on a sailing journey to the Caribbean on the famous STS Fryderyk Chopin sailing ship. When he originally floated the idea of going on a journey just 2 months into starting Global Storm we had a few eyebrows raised in the team but since we are a startup and bound to have different ways of doing business we found this a perfect opportunity to test and improve our predictive maintenance models for diesel engines.

Like many similar types of ships, Fryderyk Chopin is equipped with a diesel engine as a backup for when the wind blows in the wrong direction or not at all. As one would imagine being on a ship with a broken engine in the middle of the Caribbean sounds scary and exactly for that reason you would want to make sure that your engine is in ship! shape condition. The majority of ships have regular service intervals during which their engines and other equipment are checked and serviced. However, no one can tell a diesel engine not to break because it has just had its service done a few months before. That is exactly where our product can help.

Just 3 days before Wojciech left Poland for his trip we sat together and designed a prototype sensor for capturing and analyzing vibrations from a Scania engine onboard Fryderyk Chopin. The sensor records vibrations from the engine just like a doctor listening to your heartbeat with a stethoscope. We collect these vibration patterns and feed them to our predictive maintenance engine. The engine automatically uploads these vibration patterns as time series data into our cloud environment utilizing the magic of Starlink. We use these vibration recordings to train our time series anomaly detection models running on AWS. Over time our model learns the signature for normal working conditions of the engine completely autonomously and later it can detect when something is wrong way before it happens!

At first, we were skeptical about the viability of such an idea but lo and behold our model can now predict abnormal working conditions before even the ECU of the engine can detect it. When the slightest change in normal vibration pattern is detected currently based on simulated malfunctions such as a failing timing belt or a failing oil ring on a piston we can notify the engine operator that the engine is misbehaving. What is interesting is that when we combine this with service log data we can even tell what exactly is wrong with the engine and how long it will take for the engine to fail!

With the idea tried and tested we now want to take the next steps. Of course, more modern engines come with CAN-BUS already built-in which gives us access to a plethora of data to play with but when combined with external data sources even seemingly unrelated to the engine such as wind direction and speed then true magic can happen!
