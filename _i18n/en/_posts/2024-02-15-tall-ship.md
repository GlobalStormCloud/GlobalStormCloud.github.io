It has been some busy time for us since the last news about the box. We have worked many different angles on how to improve the design and efficiency of our box, our startup, our offerings and many other things.

One of the more interesting things we have been doing recently is Predictive Maintenance research and data collection on a Tall Ship. Wojtek had a two-month getaway planned, long before we have decided to start this amazing venture. For two months he works as a 2nd mate on a tall ship STS Fryderyk Chopin.

We have decided not to waste two months worth of time, nor this amazing opportunity. A ship has tons of amazing equipment like engines, power generators, pumps, electronics and many more that have to be monitored and maintenance. This gives us a lot of space for finding and designing solutions, improvements and upgrades that will provide more reliability and will make the life of ship's chief engineer a bit easier.

One of the challenge here is the connectivity, which, especially in case of internet, is non-existent or very limited in the middle of the sea. This means all solutions need to be very well optimized and work offline to have any chance for real world use.

This opportunity also gave us a chance, to test Starlink, which works wonderfully close to the shore and pretty well on the sea. This solves the limited connectivity issue mentioned above. Starlink is a bit pricey, but possibly in the future it can open ships and yachts to e-mobility. This gave us some really cool IoT ideas, we could implement on the ship. Testing Starlink also gave us assurance that having a camping workation in the middle of nowhere is quite possible and is something, that we will definitely do in the near future.

Lastly, if you are wondering, what are 2nd Mate's responsibilities on the ship, besides collecting data for IoT purposes:
- Navigation watch from 4-8 am & pm
- Handling the crew, lines and sails on mid-ship during maneuvers
- Keeping paper charts up to date
- Planning the route of the cruise
- Transporting crew using dingy
- Other small tasks like changing a navigation lightbulb on top of a 5 story high mast for example
