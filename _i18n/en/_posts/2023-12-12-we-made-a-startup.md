We are a startup active in the field of (Internet of Things) IoT with great ambitions to help our customers achieve their industry 4.0 and digital transition goals. We are experts at helping customers receive, store and analyze petabytes of real-time IoT data from any consumer or industrial machine. We donâ€™t just help our customers collect and store data but help them make sense of it.

Actually the idea of starting a new company was floated around when two of our founders, Wojciech and Mohsen, started working on an e-mobility project with great demands for scalability and availability based on AWS cloud.
The customer was a bus manufacturing company in Poland wishing to ingest huge amounts of real-time data from thousands of public transport vehicles. The aim of the project was to deliver an e-mobility solution for a large bus manufacturing company. The project was based on AWS could and was designed from bottom up to be very highly available and scalable.

During the course of the project Wojciech and Mohsen realized that there was a need in the market for a purpose designed edge hardware with specific focus on ingesting huge amounts of real-time data and deep integration with AWS cloud. As a result and to help the project they rapidly designed and manufactured an engineering prototype in about 3 weeks. This cooperation was so fruitful that Wojciech and Mohsen decided to form a company together to better serve the needs of customers in the field of IoT and IIoT market.
