## Introduction

GSE-1.0 was our first attempt at designing a reliable, compact edge compute solution.

We built it to test core ideas in remote data acquisition, edge processing, and cellular cloud sync.

## Prototype Highlights

- Compact aluminum enclosure
- LTE and GNSS module
- Cellular-first connectivity
- Based on Raspberry Pi CM4

While GSE-1.0 never shipped commercially, it shaped everything that followed.
