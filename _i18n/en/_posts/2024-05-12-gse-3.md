We are proud to present GES-3.0 which is a proper edge computing solution that will not find anywhere else on the market.

For the past few months, we played with several concepts and had to overcome lots of engineering problems. Starting from the O-ring groove to a box that could be machined with a CNC machine and die-cast in aluminum at a reasonable cost is not to be taken lightly.

GSE-3.0 presented in the pictures is set up for Mobility solutions in mind, however it is design with multitasking in mind, and is adaptable to any challenging solutions like in fully remote locations, marine time solutions or manufacturing.
