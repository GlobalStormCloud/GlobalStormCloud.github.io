## Why We Built It

After the release of GSE-1.0, we needed a better enclosure for mobile edge solutions. So we designed an industrial IP68-rated housing from scratch.

## Engineering Highlights

- IP68-rated aluminum enclosure
- Internal redesign for CNC and die-casting
- Overhauled electronics and software

## In Progress

We're finalizing heat dissipation fins and electronics integration for upcoming release.
