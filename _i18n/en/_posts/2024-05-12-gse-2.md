We've been quiet lately, but we're just biding our time. After the release of GSE-1.0 we concluded that we needed a better enclosure for our mobility edge solution. As a result, we set a goal to design and manufacture an industrial enclosure from scratch. However, designing an IP68-rated industrial enclosure for mass production was more involved than we first thought.

For the past few months, we played with several concepts and had to overcome lots of engineering problems. Starting from the O-ring groove to a box that could be machined with a CNC machine and die-cast in aluminum at a reasonable cost is not to be taken lightly.

Calculating heat dissipation while making the fins machinable is a serious engineering task. but thanks to our team of engineers we have made good progress and will soon have GES-2.0 with its overhauled electronics and software stack released to the market. we have attached some pictures capturing parts of the process!

Again big thanks to our hero Wojciech Zydecki for his dedication to this project.
